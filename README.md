# NYC-SUBWAY-DATA-ANALYSIS
Project Overview
In this Project, you look at NYC Subway Data to find out whether more people ride the subway when it’s raining versus when it’s not.

We will compare New York City Subway data, use statistical methods and data visualization to draw an interesting conclusion about the subway with the dataset that we have analyzed.
